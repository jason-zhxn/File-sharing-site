Creative description: We created a dynamic user system! Basically, once an unrecognized username is entered, a new page prompting you to make a new account if you want to is pulled up. Next, if you choose to make a new user, your new username will be stored in our hidden users.txt and a new directory will be created for you. You can now login with your new username and use our file service! Also, our system allows for tons of new users to be created, not only just one. Thanks!
